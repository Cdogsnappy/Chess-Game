# Reminders

Just did some cleaning and organizing for reference because this confuses both of us
To reference the actual board matrix, use Game.board.get_board()
Board index is in (y,x) format with the top left being (0,0)
I changed the input to be all lowercase just for ease, input as a#;b#
move_input returns a list [y-from, x-from, y-to, x-to]
